## Steps to Deploy API in Cloud Run

1. Looking for references dataset
2. labeling each data
3. Divide the data in a ratio of 80% (train), 10% (validation) and 10% (test)
4. Augmenting image data and Tuning hyperparameter
5. Conduct machine learning model training experiments with 10,000 to 20,000 train steps
6. Evaluate the machine learning model 
7. Testing real data using another image
8. Save the model with format h5
9. Deploy the model
